Design Assessment Animals Project:

Deadline = by 12.00

Submission:

One file only: 
    Main.java, runnable as-is.
    Submit via repo link or email attachment.

    At the top of Main.java, include a header comment stating:
    What you refactored. 


INTENT:
This is a design-focused refactoring exercise.
Functionality is intentionally minimal, your goal is to improve structure, 
reduce smells, and show clean OO thinking, not to build new features.

The existing implementation contains deliberate design problems.
You should improve the design while keeping behaviour recognisably similar.

Required:

Refactor & Redesign:
    Encapsulation
    Remove smells - 30+ smells when code quality checker is run. 
    Meaningful naming & structure

Factory/Centralised Creation:
    Main() must no longer call new Dog(...), new Cat(...), etc. directly
    Adding a new species should require minimal change outside the factory

Meaningful multi Thread:    
    Add one thread - the thread must call a named method.
    Use Thread or Runnable.

Constraints:
    Must remain one file only: Main.java
    Output may differ slightly but must remain recognisable
    No additional libraries
    No need to over-engineer

Marking Breakdown:
Refactor & Redesign Quality: 60%
Factory/Construction Abstraction: 20%
Background Thread: 20%
Discretionary: 10%
